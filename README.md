### 🎓 What Drives Me

I'm passionate about bridging the gap between advanced robotics theory and practical real-world applications. Whether it's implementing cutting-edge control algorithms for autonomous vehicles or building simple Arduino systems that solve everyday problems, I believe the best engineering happens when complex technology becomes elegantly simple solutions.

My projects span from graduate-level research (MPC for autonomous driving) to practical business applications (biometric attendance systems), because I think the most valuable engineers are those who can work across the entire spectrum - from theory to implementation to real-world deployment.

### 🌟 Core Strengths

**Technical Versatility:** From low-level embedded programming to high-level system architecture  
**Problem-Solving Mindset:** I see inefficiencies and build solutions (traffic lights, attendance systems)  
**Real-World Focus:** Every project is tested with actual users and real constraints  
**Business Understanding:** I consider ROI, user experience, and practical deployment  
**Continuous Learning:** Always exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries
